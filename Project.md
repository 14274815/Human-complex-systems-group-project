Causal Loop Diagram

I. Consult the literature and identify some key variables or factors associated with the issue or problem that you are considering.  These would be the variables and factors that influence the issue either directly or indirectly e.g. in general, demand for something will affect its price.

II. Construct a detailed Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) Indicating how the variables and factors inter-relate to influence each other to affect the issue/problem.  Indicate your link and loop polarities (using + and â€“signs, for example).  You may use the online tool Loopy for this purpose, or any other method you are familiar with. 

III. From your CLD, identify potential interventions you could make to redress the issue/problem.

IV. Recommend, with justification, which of the interventions you identified in 6.3 should be the one adopted.
