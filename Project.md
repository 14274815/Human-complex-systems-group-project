# 1. Introduction #

1.1. State the problem, why it is important/relevant to you and/or more broadly to society.

Australian bushfires are a regular, yearly occurrence. Having lived in a rural area before moving to an urban suburb, I can infer that these bushfires will affect everyone regardless of whether they live in the country or the city.

# 2. Context, background information, justification #

2.1. Research and review literature, news, digital media, drivers and how the problem is being addressed by academia, industry, government, etc. 

In Australia, bushfires are a reoccurring, destructive force of nature. Historically, Australia’s worst fires have been set up by record high temperatures, low levels of humidity and strong winds (Williams, 2011). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (2020), the 2019-2020 bushfires have destroyed over 18 million hectares of land, razed over 5900 buildings (of which 2800 were people’s homes). Additionally, they note that they have negative impacts on ecology and biodiversity, public health, other countries, mental health, the economy, agriculture, and the climate.

These fires are combated by thousands of firefighters and pilots, utilising aircraft to effectively suppress them (British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC], 2020). Additionally, the BBC (2020) states that Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister during the 2019-20 wildfires, and his government have been criticised for their slow response to the disaster. The BBC (2020) also notes that he is being urged by the country to reduce carbon emissions but also is a supporter of the coal industry.

2.2. Identify the system + stakeholders. For this, you will need to construct a “rich picture” that captures the essential elements. 

Bushfires are caused by natural causes and human interference, but the factors which set up the ideal conditions for them are created by many things. As stated earlier, the worst wildfires are caused by high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds. According to Geoscience Australia (n.d.), higher temperatures increase the odds of a fire igniting from lightning strikes due to the fuel being closer to its ignition point. Adapt NSW (n.d.) states that increasing temperatures are caused by climate change, caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide. They further explain that human activities like fossil fuel burning, deforestation and agriculture have accelerated the addition of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Therefore, individuals and industries involved in the man-made addition of carbon dioxide are stakeholders. Furthermore, firefighters and Indigenous communities which practice fire management traditions may be interested.

Using these stakeholders and considering elements related to those, I constructed the following rich picture:
 

2.3. Identify current models or prevailing frames that are being used to address the problem.

Nolan and Thornton (2016) simplified the notion of starting and sustaining a fire to require 3 basic things: fuel, heat, and oxygen. Many technologies are developed based on this prevailing frame. For example, Amicus is an Australian software that predicts the behaviour of bushfires using computer modelling (Francis and McLintock, 2013). Computer models involve technology creating abstract models to simulate behaviours and responses (Francois, 2021). The data input into the model includes current and future weather conditions (heat and oxygen), fuel load (fuel), moisture (heat), vegetation and topography (fuel).

2.4. Discuss how prevailing models/frames are preventing the problem from being fully addressed or solved.

The computer models which predict fire behaviours can be quite limited. Fires can be unpredictable. Even artificial intelligence, computers which make responses based on past experiences, cannot predict a fire if it starts to behave in an unseen way (Watson, 2019). 

Additionally, there seems to be a focus on reacting to fires after they appear, neglecting preventive measures that reduce a fire’s destructive power and spread.

# 3. Conceptual models #

3.1. Based on your self-study of the supermarket of models, explain the three models that you have chosen to look at the problem.

I will use system dynamics model to identify cause and effect of various elements which effect bushfires. This allows me to address main issues that allows the problem to function. 
Additionally, agent-based modelling allows me to understand directly fires caused by human intervention. Understanding human behaviour helps me think of how to prevent it as a human being.
Then, power law distributions help me understand how bush fires spread. Knowing this may help me base solutions around it.

3.2. Explain how each of the three models works (brief) and how it will be applied in your case. 

System dynamics, more specifically, the Causal loop diagram part visually represents the ongoing relationships between various elements. These relationships can be positive or negative – either empowering the element or reducing it. I will use this to find the root causes of the bushfire problem as well as insert elements and see how they interact with the others.

Furthermore, I will use agent-based models to explore how humans (whether intentionally or unintentionally) start and enable fires. Agent-based modelling models a system as an environment where agents interact with each other and the environment. The “agents” are the individual system elements which mutually interact to enable system functions, while the “environment” is the area of which the system functions on.

Finally, the self-organized criticality model of power laws will be used to model wildfire behaviour – the spread of destruction, the odds of a fire starting. Power-law distributions (also known as long-tail distributions) are a representation of large events in the graphical shape of exponentially decreasing relations (think of a y=1/x graph’s 1st quadrant). They are produced by systems with interdependent interactions like the spreading of fires. In terms of probability, they include large events of low frequency and small events of high frequency.

3.3. Describe any data sources (real or hypothetical) that are needed to construct the three models. Use illustrative drawings and diagrams where possible.

To construct these models to learn about the causes, behaviour, and solutions to the problem, I will need various data sources. Data such as how increased carbon levels increase fire frequencies and destruction, the percentage of fires started by humans, the portion of human fires started deliberately by arsonists, the portion started accidentally, whether the arsonists were mentally afflicted, the odds of a wildfires spawning from a dropped cigarette, the spread of the trees involved in the fire, the weather conditions before and during the fire etc.
